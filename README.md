This project is split into two seperate components - a Node Server (/server), and a React client (/client).  The server wraps TVDB calls for show information, and so requires an API key specified in your environment variables.

**you must run two seperate instances each for the server and client**

**You need an environment variable on your OS called TVDB_API_KEY** to connect to TVDB for show information.  You can get a new API key by setting up an account at www.tvdb.com.

You also need an instance of **MongoDB** running.
